## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: What is LCP?**
A: LCP (Liquid Context Protocol) is an open protocol specification for autonomous AI context orchestration. See the [README](../README.md) for details.

**Q: Is LCP production-ready?**
A: LCP is currently in draft status (v0.1). We're gathering feedback and iterating on the specification. Not recommended for production use yet.

**Q: How does LCP relate to MCP and A2A?**
A: LCP complements MCP (data connections) and A2A (agent coordination) by providing the orchestration layer for discovery, negotiation, verification, and settlement. See [docs/01-introduction.md](../docs/01-introduction.md#relationship-to-existing-protocols).

### Technical Questions

**Q: Which blockchain does LCP require?**
A: LCP is blockchain-agnostic. The specification defines interfaces that can work with Ethereum, other EVM chains, or alternative settlement layers.

**Q: Do I need to implement everything in the specification?**
A: No. LCP defines core primitives and optional extensions. Implement what's relevant for your use case. See [docs/09-extensions.md](../docs/09-extensions.md).

**Q: Where are the reference implementations?**
A: Reference implementations are coming soon. Track progress in the [Roadmap](../ROADMAP.md).

### Contributing Questions

**Q: How can I contribute?**
A: See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines. Contributions of all types are welcome!

**Q: I found a typo. Should I open an issue?**
A: For small typos or formatting issues, feel free to submit a PR directly. For larger changes, open an issue first.

**Q: Can I propose changes to the protocol?**
A: Yes! For substantial changes, use the RFC process. See [rfcs/0001-template.md](../rfcs/0001-template.md).

### Implementation Questions

**Q: Can I build a commercial product using LCP?**
A: Yes! LCP is MIT licensed. You're free to use it for commercial purposes.

**Q: Where do I report implementation bugs?**
A: Report to the implementation maintainers, not this specification repo (unless it's a spec issue).

**Q: How do I stay updated?**
A: Watch this repo, subscribe to GitHub Discussions, and check the [Changelog](../CHANGELOG.md).
