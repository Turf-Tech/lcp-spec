# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the Liquid Context Protocol (LCP) community pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community focused on advancing trustless AI context orchestration.

## Our Standards

### Expected Behavior

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- **Be Respectful**: Treat all community members with respect and professionalism
- **Be Constructive**: Provide helpful, actionable feedback in discussions and code reviews
- **Be Collaborative**: Work together to solve problems and advance the protocol
- **Be Patient**: Remember that people have varying levels of experience and expertise
- **Be Inclusive**: Welcome newcomers and help them get started
- **Be Transparent**: Clearly communicate intentions, especially when proposing significant changes
- **Assume Good Faith**: Give others the benefit of the doubt in disagreements
- **Focus on Technical Merit**: Evaluate proposals and contributions based on their technical value
- **Acknowledge Contributions**: Give credit where it's due
- **Learn and Teach**: Share knowledge and be open to learning from others

### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- **Harassment**: Offensive comments, personal attacks, trolling, or sustained disruption
- **Discrimination**: Discriminatory language or actions based on personal characteristics
- **Intimidation**: Threats, stalking, or unwelcome sexual attention
- **Dishonesty**: Plagiarism, misrepresenting credentials, or deliberately spreading misinformation
- **Privacy Violations**: Publishing others' private information without consent
- **Professional Misconduct**: Abuse of power, conflicts of interest without disclosure
- **Spam**: Excessive self-promotion, advertising, or off-topic content
- **Bad Faith Engagement**: Intentionally derailing discussions or wasting maintainers' time
- **Weaponizing Standards**: Using this Code of Conduct to suppress legitimate technical criticism

## Technical Disagreements

### Healthy Technical Debate

We encourage robust technical debate. Disagreement is natural and often leads to better outcomes. When disagreeing:

- **Focus on Ideas, Not People**: Critique the proposal, not the person
- **Provide Rationale**: Explain your reasoning with technical arguments
- **Cite Evidence**: Reference research, implementations, or prior art when possible
- **Propose Alternatives**: Don't just criticize; suggest improvements
- **Accept Decisions**: Once a decision is made through proper governance, respect it
- **Escalate Appropriately**: Use RFC process for major disagreements, not personal channels

### Unproductive Behavior in Technical Discussions

Avoid:
- Dismissing ideas without explanation
- Making technical decisions based on authority rather than merit
- Bikeshedding (excessive focus on trivial details)
- Moving goalposts during review
- Reopening settled discussions without new information

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all LCP community spaces, including:

- GitHub repositories (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Community chat channels (Discord, Slack, etc.)
- Mailing lists and forums
- Official social media accounts
- In-person events (conferences, meetups, hackathons)
- Private communications when representing the LCP community

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to:

- **Email**: conduct@lcp.org (if available)
- **GitHub**: Open a private security advisory
- **Direct Contact**: Reach out to project maintainers listed in [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md)

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter.

### What to Include in a Report

- Your contact information
- Names (real or usernames) of individuals involved
- Description of the incident, including:
  - When and where it occurred
  - What happened
  - Whether it's ongoing
- Links to relevant issues, comments, or messages
- Any additional context or evidence
- Whether you've reported this elsewhere

### Confidentiality

All reports will be kept confidential. In cases requiring community notification, reporter identity will be protected unless explicit permission is given.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining consequences:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other unprofessional behavior.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning providing clarity around the violation and explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with involved parties for a specified period. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with involved parties during this time. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment, or aggression toward individuals or groups.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from all public interaction within the community.

## Appeals

If you believe you've been unfairly sanctioned, you may appeal by:

1. Emailing the maintainers with your appeal
2. Providing new information or context
3. Explaining why you believe the decision was incorrect

Appeals will be reviewed by maintainers not involved in the original decision. The appeal decision is final.

- Clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior
- Taking appropriate and fair corrective action in response to violations
- Removing, editing, or rejecting contributions that violate this Code of Conduct
- Banning temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful
- Leading by example in demonstrating these standards
